        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            In my own time I like to play video games, play sports with my family. As you can see I play sports here in Aiea High School, my favorite sport to play is football. I love to play this sport because it requires being a team.
            Another favorite thing I like to do on my own time is watch NFL. I really love watching the NFL because at first it can be funny because the players but getting mad can be really fun to watch in the NFL. My All-time favorite team to watch is the Green Bay Packers.

          <p> I will be sharing about my game it is called "Reality Awaken". About the game, there is four friends and they get sucked into the game but their goal is to escape and defeat the bosses. The players in the game will be using teamwork and try to survive together. This game is all about reading and vocab if te player gets defeated then you can restart but it'll but on a different level. One thing I learned is teamwork makes the dream work even though you don't know anybody. Secondly, one thing I would do differently is to make more weapons because we only have a sword as a weapon. The process was really different when we had a another game in our minds then this one. Until others joined our group it was something we argeed to after discussing. Our designs started off with locations, weapons, items, special items, and our maps. Then we created the name "Reality Awaken". Then we made the four players that are playable. Then that was final for our product design.  </p>
